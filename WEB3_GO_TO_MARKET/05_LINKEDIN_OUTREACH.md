## INMAILS (Sales Navigator)

### InMail 1: Problem-Focused

```
Subject: [Company]'s infrastructure & quantum readiness

Hi [Name],

Quick question: is quantum-safe cryptography on [Company]'s roadmap?

I'm working with Web3 teams to future-proof their infrastructure 
with post-quantum mesh networking. Companies like [similar company] 
are already evaluating this.

Would 15 minutes make sense to explore if this fits your plans?

[Your name]
```

### InMail 2: Value-First

```
Subject: Thought you'd find this interesting

Hi [Name],

Just published analysis on post-quantum readiness in DeFi — 
[link to blog/doc]. Given [Company]'s focus on security, 
thought you might find it useful.

If quantum-safe infrastructure is on your radar, happy to chat 
about what we're building.

[Your name]
```

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Who to Engage With

1. **Tier 1 contacts** — Comment on everything they post
2. **Web3 influencers** — Build visibility
3. **Security researchers** — Establish credibility
4. **Developers in target companies** — Multiple entry points

### Comment Templates

**Technical post:**
```
Great breakdown, [Name]. The point about [specific detail] is key. 
We're seeing similar patterns with post-quantum migration — 
the earlier teams start, the smoother it goes.
```

**Company announcement:**
```
Congrats on [achievement], [Company] team! Exciting to see 
continued innovation in [area]. Looking forward to seeing what's next.
```

**Industry news:**
```
Important development. The implications for [specific area] 
are significant. [Add brief, valuable insight].
```

### DON'T:
- ❌ "Great post!" (zero value)
- ❌ Pitch in comments
- ❌ Self-promote constantly
- ❌ Generic comments on everything

### DO:
- ✅ Add genuine insight
- ✅ Ask thoughtful questions
- ✅ Share relevant experience
- ✅ Be consistently helpful

## CONTENT TO SHARE

### Content Calendar (Week 1)

| Day | Content Type | Topic |
|-----|--------------|-------|
| Mon | Industry insight | "Q-day timeline for Web3" |
| Wed | Technical tip | "PQC basics in 5 points" |
| Fri | Engagement | Reshare interesting post + add value |

### Post Templates

**Industry Insight:**
```
🔒 Post-quantum cryptography isn't a 2030 problem.

NIST just standardized ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Migration takes years.

Web3 teams handling billions in TVL should be planning now, 
not when quantum computers are in production.

What's your team's quantum readiness plan?

#Web3 #Security #Cryptography
```

**Technical Tip:**
```
5 things Web3 devs should know about post-quantum crypto:

1. ECDSA (used everywhere) will be broken
2. ML-KEM-768 is the new NIST standard for key exchange
3. ML-DSA-65 replaces ECDSA for signatures
4. Hybrid mode = classical + PQ for transition
5. Start planning migration NOW, not later

Which one surprises you most?

## PROFILE OPTIMIZATION

### Headline

**Before:** "Founder at x0tta6bl4"

**After:** "Building quantum-safe mesh infrastructure for Web3 | Post-quantum crypto | Decentralized networks"

### About Section

```
I help Web3 teams future-proof their infrastructure with 
post-quantum cryptography and self-healing mesh networks.

🔐 Problem I solve:
Quantum computers will break current encryption (ECDSA, RSA) 
within 5-10 years. Migration takes time. The teams who start 
now will have a security advantage.

🛠️ What I'm building:
x0tta6bl4 — mesh networking with NIST-standard post-quantum 
crypto (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65) and AI-powered self-healing.

🎯 Who I help:
• L2 solutions (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync)
• DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap)
• Infrastructure providers (Chainlink, The Graph)
• DAOs and governance platforms

📬 Let's talk: [email] | [calendly link]
```
