## TEMPLATE 1: L2 Solutions

### Subject Lines (A/B test)
```
A: Quantum-safe infrastructure for [Company]'s sequencer
B: [Name], question about [Company]'s node resilience
C: Post-quantum security before Q-day hits Web3
```

### Body

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] just [recent news/achievement — be specific].

Quick question: how are you thinking about quantum-resistant cryptography for sequencer-to-node communication?

We built x0tta6bl4 — mesh infrastructure with:
• ML-KEM-768 (NIST post-quantum standard)
• Self-healing with <3 min recovery
• Byzantine fault tolerance built-in

[Company]'s [specific component] could benefit from quantum-safe channels before competitors start marketing "quantum-ready."

15 min demo? I can show live key exchange that's already quantum-resistant.

[Your name]

P.S. [Personalized note — their blog post, tweet, or conference talk]

## TEMPLATE 2: DeFi Protocols

### Subject Lines
```
A: Protecting [Company]'s $[TVL]B from quantum threats
B: [Name], oracle feeds + post-quantum = ?
C: What's [Company]'s Q-day contingency?
```

### Body

```
Hi [Name],

[Company] securing $[X]B+ is impressive. But here's what keeps infra teams up at night: quantum computers will break ECDSA within 5-10 years.

x0tta6bl4 offers quantum-resistant mesh networking:

✓ ML-KEM-768/ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 203/204)
✓ Self-healing infrastructure (MTTD 20s, MTTR <3min)  
✓ Perfect for multi-chain oracle communication

Your oracle feeds and keeper bots could run on quantum-safe channels today — before it's a competitive requirement.

Worth a 15-min call to see if this fits [Company]'s roadmap?

[Your name]

P.S. Saw your [recent tweet/blog] about [topic] — [relevant comment].

## TEMPLATE 3: Infrastructure Providers

### Subject Lines
```
A: Partnership: quantum-safe layer for [Company] customers
B: [Name], adding PQC to [Company]'s stack?
C: Your customers' quantum-readiness gap
```

### Body

```
Hi [Name],

[Company] powers [X]+ Web3 projects. What if you could offer them quantum-resistant communication as a feature?

x0tta6bl4 is mesh infrastructure with:
• Post-quantum crypto (NIST ML-KEM-768)
• Self-healing (auto-recovery <3 min)
• Easy integration via API

**Partnership idea:** Bundle x0tta6bl4 with [Company]'s [product] — your customers get quantum-safe infra, you get differentiation.

Interested in exploring? 15 min this week?

P.S. [Personal note about their product/recent announcement]

## TEMPLATE 4: DAOs

### Subject Lines
```
A: Decentralized governance needs decentralized infra
B: [DAO name]'s infrastructure resilience
C: Mesh networking for [DAO name]
```

### Body

```
Hi [Name],

[DAO name]'s commitment to decentralization is clear. But is your infrastructure as decentralized as your governance?

x0tta6bl4 = mesh networking built for DAOs:
• No single point of failure
• Post-quantum cryptography (future-proof)
• Self-healing (no manual intervention)
• DAO-native governance integration

Your voting infrastructure and treasury operations could run on truly decentralized, quantum-safe mesh.

15 min to explore if this aligns with [DAO]'s values?

[Your name]

P.S. [Reference to their recent proposal or governance decision]

## TEMPLATE 5: Linux Infrastructure / DevOps

### Subject Lines
```
A: eBPF-based self-healing for [Company]'s Linux infra
B: [Name], MTTR 3-5 sec vs 2-3 hours — worth 15 min?
C: x0tta6bl4: mesh networking that actually uses eBPF
```

### Body

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] runs [X] Linux servers. Quick question: when one node fails, how long does recovery take?

Most teams say 2-3 hours. x0tta6bl4 reduces this to 3-5 seconds using eBPF-based self-healing mesh.

**What makes it unique for Linux:**
• eBPF as core (not a plugin) → packet routing at NIC level
• Works on any Linux distro (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Alpine)
• Post-quantum crypto built-in (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65)
• Zero-trust at eBPF level → no additional software needed

**Real example:** ISP reduced BGP recovery from 30 sec to 500ms.

Worth a 15-min demo? I can show live failover in action.

P.S. [Reference to their infrastructure blog post or tech stack]

## TEMPLATE 6: Security/Audit Firms (Partnership)

### Subject Lines
```
A: Partnership opportunity: PQC infrastructure
B: [Name], recommending quantum-safe infra to clients?
C: Post-quantum — from audit finding to solution
```

### Body

```
Hi [Name],

[Company] audits the best protocols in Web3. When you flag "consider post-quantum migration" — what do you recommend they actually use?

x0tta6bl4 is production-ready quantum-safe mesh:
• NIST FIPS 203/204 compliant (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
• Self-healing architecture
• Built for Web3 from day one

**Partnership idea:** When clients need PQC infrastructure, recommend x0tta6bl4. We can offer your clients preferred pricing and co-branded security docs.

Worth discussing? 15 min this week?

[Your name]

P.S. [Reference to their recent audit report or blog post]

Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Last ping on this. I know you're busy shipping.

One thing I didn't mention: we just [recent achievement/milestone].

If quantum-safe infrastructure isn't a priority right now, totally understand. But if it is, my calendar's open: [Calendly link]

### Day 14 Break-up

```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about quantum-safe mesh infrastructure.

I'll assume timing isn't right and won't follow up again.

If infra security becomes a priority, here's how to reach me: [email/calendar]

Wishing [Company] continued success.
