Subject: AI Root Cause Analysis in 15 seconds [Interactive Demo Inside]

---

Hey [Name],

Following up on x0tta6bl4 Self-Healing Mesh Platform.

We've built something unique: AI-powered root cause analysis that identifies 
exact causes of incidents with 95%+ confidence.

🎯 See it in action (15 seconds):
👉 [LIVE DEMO LINK]

What you'll see:
├─ Anomaly detected (GraphSAGE: 98% confidence)
├─ Service dependency graph lights up in real-time
├─ Root causes identified automatically
└─ Recommended fixes: [Actionable list]

This is production-ready:
✓ Zero-Trust Core (mTLS + SPIFFE/SPIRE)
✓ K8s-ready deployment
✓ Running on our mesh network

Differentiator vs standard observability:
❌ Standard: "Something broke" (you investigate)
✅ x0tta6bl4: "Memory leak in Cache pod caused API slowdown" (95% confidence)

Want to see a 15-min demo?
[Schedule Link] or reply to this email.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. The demo is interactive - click "Load Demo Incident" to see it in action.
