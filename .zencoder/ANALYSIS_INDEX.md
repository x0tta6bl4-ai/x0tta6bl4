## 📞 Questions & Decisions

3. **How much capital available?** (If <$140K, prioritize B2B over marketplace)
4. **What's the tolerance for failure?** (If low, focus on B2B enterprise first)

### Tactical Questions (Answer in Week 1)
1. **Which geographic market first?** (Recommend: Southeast Asia, Africa, or Latin America)

4. **When to launch token?** (Recommend: Q4 2026 after traction proven)
