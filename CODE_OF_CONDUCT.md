### Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact@x0tta6bl4.com](mailto:contact@x0tta6bl4.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of reporters and will not disclose reporter information without explicit permission.
