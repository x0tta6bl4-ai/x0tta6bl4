Subject: Quick Follow-Up: 7-Day Mesh Resilience Pilot

Hi [NAME],

Following up on my earlier note regarding a 7-day resilience mesh pilot for [COMPANY]. If this landed at a busy moment, a quick recap:
- MTTR target < 2.0s (self-healing mesh layer)
- Identity isolation (SPIFFE/mTLS) + adaptive routing
- Focused audit & deployment playbook in one week
- Fixed 200K RUB, minimal lift (~6–8h engineer time)

Goal: quantify recovery improvements before deeper investment.

If relevant: can we lock a 30-min scope call this week? Proposed slots: [2 TIME OPTIONS]
If not a fit right now, just let me know — I won’t spam.

Thanks,
