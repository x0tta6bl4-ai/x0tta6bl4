Hi! I can integrate Snyk + Trivy into your CI and deliver a single HTML security report with fail gates.

Scope
- CI job (GitLab/GitHub), JSON + HTML artifacts, thresholds (fail CRITICAL=0, warn HIGH=5)
- Optional: SBOM, PR comments with findings

Deliverables (3 days, fixed $600–1000)
- security-scan.sh + CI job + trivy.yaml
- README with 30-min integration guide
- 1 training session

Questions
- Git platform (GitLab/GitHub)? Image registry? SNYK_TOKEN available?
- Scan scope: container image or repo filesystem?

I can start within 24h.
