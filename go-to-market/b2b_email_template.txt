Subject: Accelerate Your Network Resilience: 7-Day Mesh Pilot Proposal

Hi [ИМЯ / NAME],

I’m reaching out because [КОМПАНИЯ] operates in an environment where every minute of network instability costs focus and revenue. We’re building x0tta6bl4 — a self-healing, zero-trust mesh layer that keeps internal services reachable even under partial outages.

Pilot (7 days):
- Slot-based sync (no GPS dependency)
- mTLS / SPIFFE identity isolation
- Adaptive routing (Graph-based ML)
- MTTR target: < 2.0s (we’re already at 2.4s with 25 nodes)
- Optional: LoRa long-range fallback

Deliverables for your team:
- Resilience audit (current failure modes)
- Deployment playbook (Kubernetes + fallback transport)
- Policy-as-Code examples (OPA, Zero-Trust decisions)
- Metrics dashboard (latency, convergence, recovery time)

Commercial outline:
- Cost of pilot: 200,000 RUB (fixed)
- Duration: 7 calendar days
- Effort: ~6–8 engineer hours your side
- Outcome: Go/No-Go decision with quantified benefits

Why now:
- Q4 attack surface expansion
- Internal latency targets tightening
- Rising dependency on distributed eventing and edge nodes

Next step: Short technical call (30 minutes) to confirm scope and adapt to your environment.

P.S. If mTLS sandbox limitations interest you, I can show our hybrid libp2p + SPIFFE path during the call.
