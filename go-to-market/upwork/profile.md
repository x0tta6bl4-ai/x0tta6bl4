# Upwork Profile

## Title
DevSecOps Engineer | CI/CD Automation | Security Gates (Snyk+Trivy) | AI Bug Detection

## Overview
I accelerate releases and reduce risk with DevSecOps and smart pipelines.
What I deliver fast and end-to-end:
- Security Gates: Snyk + Trivy → HTML reports, fail-gates, SBOM
- GitLab/GitHub CI/CD setup → build/test/cache, artifacts, deploy hooks
- AI Bug Detection → log intelligence, PR comments, lower MTTR
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana → dashboards and alerts
Why me:
- Ready-made templates and offers → delivery in 1–3 days
- GitLab/GitHub Actions, Docker, K8s, IaC hands-on
- Clear deliverables, documentation, and team training
Packages:
- Security Gates (3 days): $600–1000
- CI/CD Setup (1–2 days): $700–1200
- AI Bug Detection (3 days): $800–1200
