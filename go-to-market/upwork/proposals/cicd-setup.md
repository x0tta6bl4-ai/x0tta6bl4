Hi! I’ll set up a clean CI/CD pipeline (GitLab/GitHub) with build/test/cache, artifacts, and optional deploy.

Scope
- Workflow with caching, matrix, docker buildx, artifact packaging
- Optional: integration tests hook, release notes artifact

Deliverables (1–2 days, fixed $700–1200)
- CI workflow yaml + Makefile/hooks (if needed)
- Handover README and minimal runbook

Questions
- Registry creds, environments (dev/stage/prod), test suite size?
- Self-hosted runners or hosted?

Ready to start this week.
