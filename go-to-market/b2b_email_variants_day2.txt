Subject: FinCore: 7-Day Mesh Resilience Pilot to Cut Latency Risk

Hi Svetlana,

FinCore’s latency SLO tightening after Q3 incidents makes resilience visibility critical. x0tta6bl4 is a self-healing zero-trust mesh layer keeping internal services reachable during partial failures.

Pilot (7 days):
- Slot-based sync (no GPS)
- mTLS / SPIFFE identity isolation
- Adaptive ML routing (convergence < 2.4s → target < 2.0s)
- Optional LoRa fallback for disconnected zones

Deliverables:
- Focused resilience audit (FinCore failure modes)
- Kubernetes deployment playbook + fallback transport
- OPA Zero-Trust policy examples
- Metrics dashboard (latency, recovery, convergence)

Commercial:
200,000 RUB fixed • 7 days • ~6–8h engineer time on your side • Clear Go/No-Go.

Two possible call slots: Tue 11:00 MSK / Wed 16:00 MSK. Any preference?

Best,

Subject: TeleGrid: Stabilize Edge Node Churn with a 7-Day Mesh Pilot

Hi Andrei,

Regional edge node churn affects TeleGrid’s routing consistency. We built x0tta6bl4: adaptive zero-trust mesh to sustain service reachability under partial outages.

Pilot (7 days):
- Slot sync (no GPS dependency)
- SPIFFE identities + mTLS
- Graph ML adaptive routing
- LoRa fallback for fringe zones

Deliverables: edge churn audit, deployment playbook, OPA examples, metrics dashboard.

Fixed cost: 200,000 RUB. Scope call? Tue 14:00 / Wed 15:30 MSK.

Regards,
