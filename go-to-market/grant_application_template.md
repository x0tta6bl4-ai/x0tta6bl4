# Grant Application: x0tta6bl4 Zero-Trust Mesh & Accessibility Layer

## 1. Project Summary
x0tta6bl4 delivers a self-healing, slot-synchronized, zero-trust mesh networking substrate with integrated policy-as-code and accessibility enhancements for emergency and humanitarian deployments.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional network resilience solutions depend on centralized coordination (GPS, stable control planes) and lack adaptive trust enforcement in degraded environments. Accessibility compliance is often deprioritized.

## 3. Objectives (Next 3–6 Months)
- Achieve < 2.0s MTTR in 50-node clusters.
- Integrate WCAG 2.2 CLI augmentation (multi-language terminal UX).
- Deploy hybrid libp2p + mTLS identity plane.
- Launch DAO governance for community-driven evolution.

## 4. Innovation & Differentiators
- Slot-based synchronization without GPS.
- Hybrid transport (LoRa + IP overlay) for low-bandwidth continuity.
- Policy-as-Code enforcement inline (OPA integration).
- Federated ML path (routing optimization via GNN + anomaly isolation forest).

## 5. Target Impact
- Disaster recovery zones (maintain communication fabric under fragmentation).
- Civic networks & NGOs (secure coordination, decentralized governance).
- Long-range rural connectivity experiments.

## 6. Work Plan & Milestones
| Month | Milestone | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Nov 2025 | Resilience pilot (25 nodes) | Metrics report |
| Dec 2025 | Accessibility module | WCAG compliance metrics |
| Jan 2026 | Identity plane hardening | mTLS + fallback deployed |
| Feb 2026 | DAO automation | Governance dashboard |

## 7. Team
- Founder / Architect: [Name]
- Security Engineer (open position)
- DevOps Engineer (open position)
- Community & DAO coordinator (part-time)

## 8. Budget Request
| Category | RUB | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Engineering (contract) | 400,000 | Specialized resilience & security |
| Infrastructure | 60,000 | K8s clusters, observability, CI |
| Accessibility / Localization | 80,000 | Multi-language tooling |
| Community / DAO Ops | 40,000 | Governance tooling & moderation |
| Emergency Pilot Kits | 70,000 | Hardware (LoRa + edge) |
| Contingency (10%) | 65,000 | Risk buffer |
| **Total** | **715,000** |  |

## 9. KPI & Evaluation
- MTTR < 2.0s (avg across failure scenarios)
- Node coverage > 95%
- WCAG score ≥ 95
- DAO participation ≥ 60%
- Beta tester retention ≥ 70%

## 10. Sustainability Plan
Adopt dual licensing (community AGPL + commercial resilience add-ons). Monetize audits, enterprise policy packs, advanced ML routing modules.

## 11. Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Delay in identity hardening | High | Hybrid fallback (libp2p) |
| Insufficient adoption | Medium | Focused partnerships with NGOs |
| Talent acquisition lag | High | Contract specialists interim |

## 12. Compliance & Ethics
Zero-Trust by design; cryptographic isolation prevents unauthorized intercept. Accessibility ensures inclusive participation.

## 13. Closing Statement
We ask for support to accelerate a neutral, open, resilient network layer serving humanitarian and civic coordination needs.
