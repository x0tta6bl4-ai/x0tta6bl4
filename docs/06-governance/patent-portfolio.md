## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **φ-QAOA Performance Claims Unverified** | Patent rejection; credibility damage | High (60-70%) | Create reproducible benchmark suite with raw logs |
| **7653× / RSA-4096 Claims Too Aggressive** | Examiner skepticism; rejection on enablement | High (70-80%) | Provide detailed methodology, statistical analysis, conservative bounds |
| **Prior Art for QAOA Variants** | Loss of novelty for φ-QAOA claims | Medium-High (50-60%) | Perform comprehensive FTO matrix against all QAOA literature |
| **Open-Source License Conflicts** | Inadvertent patent grant under Apache 2.0 | Medium (40-50%) | Audit code implementing claims; segregate proprietary vs open |
| **Public Disclosure Before Filing** | Statutory bar in some jurisdictions | Medium (40%) | Maintain embargo on press releases until filing dates confirmed |
| **Trademark Clearance Failure** | Rebranding costs, legal disputes | Low (20-30%) | Conduct TTAB/USPTO database searches before filing |
| **Resource Constraints** | Unable to fund PCT/International filings | Medium (50%) | Prioritize US + EU; defer China unless venture funding secured |
