# 💰 Grant Application: x0tta6bl4 (The Living Network)

**Applicant**: x0tta6bl4 Collective
**Project**: Biological Mesh Network with Post-Quantum Security
**Grant Category**: Infrastructure / Privacy / AI
**Amount Requested**: $100,000 (Seed)

## 1. Executive Summary
x0tta6bl4 is a decentralized internet infrastructure that mimics biological systems. It solves the fragility of current networks using **MAPE-K self-healing loops** and ensures long-term survival against quantum threats using **NIST-standard PQC**. We have a working prototype (v3.3) with 300+ tests passing and a verified PQC implementation.

## 2. Key Differentiation
*   **Biology, not Engineering**: Traditional nets are static. Ours is dynamic. It "feels" latency and rewires itself in milliseconds.
*   **Safety for 2030**: We standardized on Kyber/Dilithium before they were cool. We are Q-Day ready today.
*   **Sovereign**: No kill switch. DAO governance prevents capture.

## 3. Evidence of Work (Artifacts)
We are submitting the following proofs of technical maturity:
1.  **Whitepaper** (`WHITEPAPER.md`): Detailed architectural thesis.
2.  **Audit Report** (`AUDIT_REPORT.md`): Verification of PQC and ML components.
3.  **Architecture** (`ARCHITECTURE.md`): System design and data flow.
4.  **Live Dashboard**: "Lotus Blossom" UI visualizing the nervous system.

## 4. Use of Funds
*   **$50k**: Independent Security Audit (Trail of Bits / Zellic).
*   **$30k**: Hardware Prototyping (Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Nodes).
*   **$20k**: Developer Grants for "Compute Marketplace" integration.

## 5. Roadmap
*   **Q2 2026**: Commercial Pilot (v3.3) - 50 paying customers.
*   **Q3 2026**: Federated Intelligence Marketplace.
*   **Q4 2026**: Global Hardware Rollout.

**Conclusion**: We are building the immune system for the internet.
