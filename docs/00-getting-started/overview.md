# Overview

x0tta6bl4 is a **post-quantum secure, self-healing mesh network** with decentralized governance, designed to provide secure and resilient communication for the next generation of the internet.

## Core Concepts

The x0tta6bl4 network is built on a 6-layer architecture that provides a comprehensive solution for secure, decentralized communication.

### Layer 1: Mesh Network
The foundation of x0tta6bl4 is a multi-hop mesh network that uses the SOCKS5 protocol for chaining nodes. This allows for dynamic routing and failover, ensuring that traffic can always find a path through the network.

### Layer 2: Post-Quantum Security
We use **Kyber768**, a NIST-selected post-quantum key exchange algorithm, to protect against threats from quantum computers. All traffic is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using keys derived from the PQC handshake.

### Layer 3: DAO Governance
The network is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), allowing the community to vote on protocol upgrades and network parameters.

### Layer 4: Distributed Data
Data is stored in a distributed manner with cryptographic verification to ensure integrity. The system is designed to support federated learning without transmitting raw data.

### Layer 5: AI/ML-driven Optimization
x0tta6bl4 uses AI/ML for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance. A GraphSAGE GNN model is planned for detecting node failures before they happen.

### Layer 6: Hybrid Search Index
The network utilizes a hybrid search index combining BM25 and vector embeddings for efficient information retrieval at the edge.
