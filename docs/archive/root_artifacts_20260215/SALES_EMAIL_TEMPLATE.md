## 🎯 EMAIL 1: Initial Outreach

### Subject Line Options

1. `x0tta6bl4: Post-Quantum Self-Healing Network (15-30x faster)`
2. `Quantum-safe mesh network that fixes itself in 20 seconds`
3. `[Name], interested in 464x faster PQC handshake?`

### Email Body

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is working on [relevant project/need]. 
I thought you might be interested in x0tta6bl4 - the first 
post-quantum self-healing mesh network.

**Why this matters:**
- 15-30x faster incident detection (20s vs 5-10 min industry standard)
- 464x faster PQC handshake (0.81ms vs 376ms RSA-2048)
- 94-98% anomaly detection accuracy (vs 70-80% industry)
- Multi-cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP ready)

**What makes us different:**
✅ NIST FIPS 203/204 Compliant (quantum-safe)
✅ Self-healing architecture (80% auto-resolution)
✅ Enterprise-grade security (SPIFFE/SPIRE, Network Policy, RBAC)
✅ Production-ready Kubernetes deployment

I'd love to show you a quick 15-minute demo. Are you available 
this week?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. We have a live demo at demo.x0tta6bl4.dev - feel free to 
check it out!
