## 📝 SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:30] INTRODUCTION

**Visual:** Logo, title card

**Script:**
```
Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to show you x0tta6bl4 - 
the first post-quantum self-healing mesh network.

By 2030, quantum computers will break all current encryption. 
x0tta6bl4 is ready NOW with NIST FIPS 203/204 compliance.

Let me show you what makes us different.

### [0:30-2:30] KEY FEATURES

**Visual:** Split screen - features + live demo

**Script:**
```
x0tta6bl4 combines three revolutionary technologies:

**First, Post-Quantum Cryptography:**
We use ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 - the official NIST standards 
finalized in August 2024. Our PQC handshake is 464x faster 
than RSA-2048 - just 0.81 milliseconds.

**Second, Self-Healing Architecture:**
Our MAPE-K system detects incidents in 20 seconds - that's 
15-30x faster than the industry standard of 5-10 minutes. 
And we auto-resolve 80% of incidents without human intervention.

**Third, AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:**
Our GraphSAGE v2 system achieves 94-98% accuracy - that's 
14-18% better than the industry average of 70-80%.

### [2:30-5:00] LIVE DEMO

**Visual:** Screen recording of live demo

**Script:**
```
Let me show you x0tta6bl4 in action.

[Open demo.x0tta6bl4.dev]

Here's our live demo environment. You can see:
- Real-time mesh network topology
- Active connections between nodes
- Health status of each component

[Click on a node]

Let me simulate a failure...

[Trigger failure scenario]

Watch what happens:
- Detection in 20 seconds ✅
- Automatic root cause analysis ✅
- Self-healing action initiated ✅
- System recovered in under 3 minutes ✅

[Show recovery complete]

This is all automatic. No human intervention needed.

Now let me show you the security features:

[Show SPIFFE/SPIRE integration]
- Zero-Trust architecture
- Automatic credential renewal
- mTLS between all services

[Show Network Policy]
- Network isolation
- RBAC for service accounts
- Secrets management
