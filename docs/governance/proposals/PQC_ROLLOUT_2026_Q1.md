# DAO Proposal: x0tta6bl4-PQC-ROLLOUT-2026-Q1

**Status:** Draft
**Type:** Network Upgrade
**Author:** Mesh Architect
**Voting Power:** Quadratic Voting (EIP-712 Snapshots)

## 1. Executive Summary
This proposal initiates the full migration of the x0tta6bl4 mesh network to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards (ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65). This upgrade is critical to ensure long-term censorship resistance and protection against "Store Now, Decrypt Later" attacks.

## 2. Technical Rationale
- **Algorithm:** NIST FIPS 204 (August 2024) standard ML-DSA-65 (formerly Dilithium3).
- **Security Level:** NIST Level 3 (equivalent to AES-192).
- **Performance Impact:** Estimated +5% CPU overhead on control-plane handshakes (validated in Sprint 9).
- **Interoperability:** 30-day grace period for hybrid (Classical+PQC) mode, followed by PQC-only enforcement.

## 3. Implementation Parameters
- **Min Version Requirement:** 3.3.0
- **Activation Block/Timestamp:** 2026-03-15 00:00:00 UTC
- **SVID Policy Update:** SPIRE rotation will enforce ML-DSA signatures for all new identities.
- **Mesh Tunneling:** Batman-adv heartbeats will require PQC-SVID attestation.

## 4. Risks & Rollback Plan
- **Risk:** Older nodes (< 3.2.0) will be disconnected.
- **Mitigation:** Automatic OTA firmware update pushed to all nodes 7 days before activation.
- **Rollback:** In case of MTTR spike > 10s, DAO can trigger a "Legacy-Failback" emergency proposal to re-enable X25519.

## 5. Voting Options
- **YES:** Proceed with full PQC rollout.
- **NO:** Delay rollout by 1 quarter for further testing.
- **ABSTAIN:** No preference.
