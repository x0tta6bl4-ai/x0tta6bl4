# Reverse Engineering Tool Index

> **This file is a TEMPLATE.** Run `refresh-tool-index.ps1` (Windows) or `refresh-tool-index.sh` (Linux) to generate the actual `tool-index.md` with your machine's real paths and versions.
>
> - Scan time: (auto-generated)
> - Routing entry: `SKILL.md` → `routing.md` → corresponding sub-skill
> - Note: For MCP servers like jshookmcp, `yes` only means the local machine has the runtime (node/npx), NOT that it's registered and enabled in your AI client.
> - **IMPORTANT**: All paths MUST be complete absolute paths (e.g., `D:\wangluo\jadx\bin\jadx.bat`). Never write just the tool name. Include version, full path, and verification command. This is the shared registry that ALL CLI clients rely on.

## How to Generate

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<SKILL_ROOT>/skills/scripts/refresh-tool-index.ps1"
```

**Linux/Kali:**
```bash
bash <SKILL_ROOT>/kali/scripts/refresh-tool-index.sh
```

After running, this template is replaced by `tool-index.md` with your machine's actual paths, versions, and availability status.
