## Post Variant 1 – r/decentralized
Title: "x0tta6bl4 v3.0: Building a 12-Week Mesh Networking Foundation"
Body:
We just launched Phase 1 of x0tta6bl4 v3.0: a 12-week push to lay down a resilient decentralized mesh networking layer.
Objectives:
- 50+ production nodes
- MTTR ≤ 7 seconds
- Uptime ≥ 95%
- Baseline latency < 50ms (LAN)
Why? Current centralized routing points are failure-prone; we need adaptive peer mesh infrastructure.
DAO vote is open (Nov 1–3) for Phase 1 scope & funding.
More: snapshot.org/#/x0tta6bl4 | github.com/x0tta6bl4/roadmap | Live dashboard soon.
Feedback welcome—especially on routing heuristics & recovery strategies.

## Post Variant 2 – r/cryptocurrency
Title: "Decentralized Mesh Stack: x0tta6bl4 Phase 1 Launch"
Body:
x0tta6bl4 is moving into an execution phase: building a fault-tolerant mesh networking foundation over 12 weeks.
Focus:
- BATMAN-adv + CJDNS baseline
- Rapid recovery (target MTTR ≤7s)
- Observability from day 1
Funding proposal live on Snapshot until Nov 3.
If you're into decentralized infra beyond consensus layers—this is for you.

## Post Variant 3 – Hacker News
Title: "Show HN: Mesh Networking Phase Launch (x0tta6bl4 v3.0)"
Body:
We're launching a 12-week initiative to stand up a production-grade decentralized mesh: routing (BATMAN-adv), peer overlay (CJDNS), observability, recovery mechanics.
Ambitious targets: MTTR ≤7s, ≥95% uptime across 50+ nodes.
Open docs & early dashboard: github.com/x0tta6bl4/roadmap
Design decisions logged (governance + infra trade-offs).
Would love technical critique: failure domains, path selection, scaling paradigms.
DAO vote currently open; not a token shill—infra engineering.

## Post Variant 4 – r/Networking
Title: "Engineering a Decentralized Mesh: Execution Sprint Kickoff"
Body:
Phase 1 started: building a resilient mesh fabric (BATMAN-adv, CJDNS) with strict recovery targets.
We're treating mesh not as hobby overlay but production substrate. Recovery target ≤7s after link failure.
Plan: iterative rollout (10 → 25 → 50 nodes), metric baselines, route stability tracking.
Looking for insights on large-scale mesh stability & routing table growth control.

## Guidelines
- Tailor tags (e.g. remove emojis for HN)
- Reply early to first 5 comments (boost ranking)
- Avoid price/token talk (infra focus)
