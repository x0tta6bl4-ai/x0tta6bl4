# Community Engagement Plan

## Objectives (Phase 1 Weeks 1–4)
- Establish steady information cadence (2–3 public updates/week)
- Collect early technical feedback on routing & recovery
- Convert observers → contributors (issues, PRs)

## Channels & Frequencies
| Channel    | Frequency | Owner         | Content Type |
|------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Twitter/X  | 3x week   | Comms Lead    | Milestones, metrics previews |
| Discord    | Daily     | Community Mod | Status, Q&A, vote reminders |
| Reddit     | 1x week   | Tech Lead     | Deep-dive / progress summary |
| Hacker News| Milestones| Eng Lead      | Show/Launch updates |

## KPI Targets (Weeks 1–4)
- Twitter impressions: 25K
- Discord active members: 300
- GitHub stars: +200
- PR contributions: 15 external
- Issue response SLA: <24h

## Content Cadence Template
Week 1:
- Day 1: Launch post (Twitter, Discord)
- Day 2: Infra status (Discord)
- Day 3: Dashboard preview (Twitter)
- Day 4: Routing baseline blog link (Discord)
- Day 5: Vote close reminder (Twitter)

## Engagement Workflow
1. Draft → Internal review (Eng + Comms) → Publish → Monitor (30m, 4h, 24h)
2. Tag issues requiring community help (#help-wanted)
3. Weekly AMA in #x0tta6bl4-general (Fridays 17:00 UTC)

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Low engagement | Early teaser metrics + targeted replies |
| Off-topic speculation | Pin purpose statement & moderate quickly |
| Negative reaction to delays | Transparent ETA updates with root cause |
| Spam / bots | Enable slow mode + CAPTCHA for onboarding |

## Tooling
- Tweet scheduling: native or Buffer
- Discord moderation: AutoMod + pinned onboarding
- Issue labeling automation: GitHub Actions workflow (triage)

## Escalation
- Technical blocker → #escalation Slack
- Governance concern → DAO delegate ping
- Security incident → Security lead on-call
