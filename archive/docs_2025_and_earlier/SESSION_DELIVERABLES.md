## 📞 WHAT TO DO NEXT

### This Week
```bash
# Verify everything still works
make test              # Run all tests
git status             # Check git is clean
df -h                  # Verify storage is good (should show 47% used)
docker build .         # Test Docker build
```

### This Month
- Review the architecture documents as a team
- Run the 5 code examples to understand the system
- Update your deployment/CI procedures if needed
- Consider Docker-based development workflow

### Ongoing
- Monitor storage monthly (should stay < 50%)
- Update .gitignore if new file types arise
- Review these documents quarterly
- Share with new team members as onboarding
