## 💀 The Problem

### Current Internet is BROKEN
- **Downtime costs**: $5,600/minute for enterprises (Gartner)
- **Recovery time**: 20-30 seconds average MTTR
- **Single points of failure**: ISPs can block/fail entire regions
- **No quantum protection**: All encryption will be broken by 2030

### Real Impact
| Sector | Cost of 1 Hour Downtime |
|--------|------------------------|
| Finance | $6.5 million |
| E-commerce | $500,000 |
| Healthcare | $1.2 million + lives |
| Government | Immeasurable |
